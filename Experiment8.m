%% Experiment 8

% Similar to Experiment7.m, but using mainly time processing, even if it's
% slower than the frequency processing.

% The analysis won't be so exhaustive, since the purpose is just proving
% that the time processing works and that the analysis processing would be
% a valid option for analysis because the correspondence between the two
% has been proven.
